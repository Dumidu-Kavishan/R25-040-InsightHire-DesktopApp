# Brief Description of  The Research Problem -
```
Traditional candidate selection methods primarily rely on resumes, academic qualifications,
and structured interviews, which often overlook essential soft skills such as confidence,
stress level, decision making ability. This gap leads to poor alignment between job roles and candidates,
causing increased employee turnover, reduced productivity, and inefficient hiring outcomes.
The research problem focuses on addressing this limitation by exploring innovative approaches
to evaluate soft skills more accurately during the recruitment process.

# Brief Description of  The Research Solution -
```
To address these issues, this research aims to develop a system that utilizes image
processing to monitor student activity. The system will track blinking rates, screen time,
posture, and facial expressions to detect signs of stress. By analyzing these factors, the system
will provide real-time reminders to encourage students to take breaks, stretch, or
adjust their posture. This approach seeks to minimize health risks associated with excessive
screen use and promote healthier study habits among students.
